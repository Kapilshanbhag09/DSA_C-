# Searching and Sorting

## Linear Search
    *Simplest method for searching
    *Time Complexity Best Case: O(1)
    *Time Complexity Worst Case: O(n)
    *Time Complexity average Case: O(n)
## Merge Sort
    *Divide the array into two parts, sort the left part and sort the right part and merge them
    *Time Complexity: O(N logN)
## Quick Sort
    *Using a pivot point element, partition the array into two sections where everything below the pivot point is smaller and everything above the pivot is larger. The pivot point then moves through the values on the left putting them in order and the then values on the right.
    *Time Complexity Average Case: O(nlogn)
