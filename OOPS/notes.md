# OOPS
## Access Modifiers
Access modifiers are used to implement an important aspect of Object-Oriented Programming known as Data Hiding. 
### Three types of Acces modifiers
### 1)Public
 All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone
### 2)Private
 All the class members declared under the public specifier will be available to everyone in the same class.
### 3)Protected
All class members declared under the protected specifiers can be accessed by that class as well as any subclass(derived class) of that class

## Encapsulation
It is the method of binding data and methods that works on data that are within class.
It is done to prevent direct access of data outside the class
Outer class can acces that data by setter and getter method

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that shows only essential attributes and hides unnecessary information

## Inheritance
Inheritance is the procedure in which one class inherits the attributes and methods of another class. 

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism is the method in an object-oriented programming language that performs different things as per the objectâ€™s class
